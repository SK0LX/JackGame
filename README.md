## About game

This game is designed for a great time. Your task is to build a skyscraper!

## Rule Game

Your task is to build a tower. The rules are very simple: If you perfectly place a block on another, then you get +3 points to your score, as well as +3 to your speed. If the block is placed crookedly, you get +1 point to your score and +1 point to your speed. Also, the tower should be approximately in the same range, that is, you cannot build a ladder from cubes, since the instability of the structure will lead to game over.
